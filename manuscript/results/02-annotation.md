**Annotation**


Of 153,982 sequences that remained after screening for putative non-eukaryote matches, 22,974 (15%) had similarity with proteins in the Swiss-Prot/Uniprot database.  Corrresponding Gene Ontology information was obtain for  but only sequences 19652 (12.73%) had GO description (is this correct). Protein similarities were 12.2 % RNA metabolism, 11.5 % transport, 10.6 % protein metabolism and 18.9 % and 17.0 %  with other metabolic and biological processes, respectively (Fig. )
