**Annotation**


Of 153,982 sequences that remained after screening for putative non-eukaryote matches, 22,974 (15%) had similarity with proteins in the Swiss-Prot/Uniprot database.  Corrresponding Biological Process Gene Ontology information was obtained for 19, 393 contigs.


Protein similarities were 12.2 % RNA metabolism, 11.5 % transport, 10.6 % protein metabolism and 18.9 % and 17.0 %  with other metabolic and biological processes, respectively (Fig. )

In comparing the Panopea transcriptome with previously described gene sets two contigs were identifed as putatively sex-specific based on work in _Crassostrea gigas_. This incudes contig comp142444, analogous to Forkhead box protein L2 and comp137246 with homology to actin, cytoplasmic A3a. $$$need to confirm not non-euk$$$.  There were 173 contigs that corresponded to gene identified in _Crassostrea gigas_ to be differentially expressed through gametogenesis.
