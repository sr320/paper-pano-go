sequences 19652 (12.73%) had similarity with proteins in the Swiss-Prot/Uniprot database. Protein similarities were 12.2 % RNA metabolism, 11.5 % transport, 10.6 % protein metabolism and 18.9 % and 17.0 %  with other metabolic and biological processes, respectively (fig. 1, <img src=https://github.com/mdelrio1/mdelrio-panopea1/blob/master/img/Panopea_annotationNoduplicatesfinal.png/ width = 50%>)
