**Sequence Assembly**

Raw sequence reads were quality trimmed using trim galore (citation) [code/output](https://github.com/sr320/paper-pano-go/wiki/Quality-trim-output), and quality assessed using FastQC (citation). Assembly of sequence reads was carried out using Trinity (citation) using the following parameters...
