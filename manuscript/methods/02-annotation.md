**Annotation**

Resulting contigs were compared to the Uniprot/Swiss-Prot protein database using BLASTx using the following parameters: an evalue threshold of 1e-05, one sequence match and one sequence per contig. Blastx results were merged with SPID and GO Numbers databases (citation [don't know the source of these databases]). Biological Process GO-slim parameters were used in order to summarize annotation. 

Interested particularly on genes involved in reproductive biology, we examined the transcriptome for previously described gene sets. One suite of genes previoiusly characterized is from Dheilly et al 2012 where researchers described sex and stage specific genes in _Crassostrea gigas_.
