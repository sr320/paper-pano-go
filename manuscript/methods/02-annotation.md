**Annotation**

Resulting contigs were compared to the Uniprot/Swiss-Prot protein database using BLASTx using the following parameters: an evalue threshold of 1e-05, one sequence match and one sequence per contig. Blastx results were merged with SPID and GO Numbers databases (citation [don't know the source of these databases]). GO-slim parameters were used in order to summarize annotation.
